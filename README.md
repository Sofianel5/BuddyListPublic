# Welcome to BuddyList

## What is BuddyList?

BuddyList is IM designed to help you stay in touch with your close friends. It's AIM-inspired desktop messaging app that combines the best aspects of different messaging protocols. BuddyList is centered around the buddy list, a window where you can set your own status and view your buddies' statuses and activity. You only use BuddyList with your close friends, so it is not weird to reach out to your buddies based on what they have as their status, nor vise versa. Your buddy list is rearrangable so you can focus on whoever you want. The status feature helps you make sure that you know you're not bothering your friends and is a more gentile channel of communication than email or text.
